Introduction to Strings

Words and sentences are fundamental to how we communicate, so it follows that we’d want our computers to be able to work
with words and sentences as well.

In Python, the way we store something like a word, a sentence, or even a whole paragraph is as a string. A string is a
sequence of characters contained within a pair of 'single quotes' or "double quotes". A string can be any length and can
contain any letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

In this lesson, we will learn more about strings and how they are treated in Python. We will learn how to slice strings,
select specific characters from strings, search strings for characters, iterate through strings, and use strings in
conditional statements.

Let’s get started.
Instructions
1.

Save your favorite word as a string to the variable favorite_word.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Strings are written inside either single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ". Just be sure they match!
"""
# Valid string using double quotes
favorite_word = "coding"

# Also valid string using single quotes
favorite_word = 'coding'
"""
2.

Print favorite_word.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

It should look something like:
"""
print(string_name)
"""
Notice how the quotes don’t appear in the output terminal.
